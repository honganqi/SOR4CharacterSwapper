## 4.3.2 - 2023/03/17 16:21:14 GMT+08:00
### Fixed

* Fixed the issue in the character select screen where the cursor doesn't go to the SOR4 characters when coming SOR1/SOR2 characters

## 4.3.1 - 2023/03/17 03:26:03 GMT+08:00

### Fixed

* Training Mode item list now fixed

## 4.3.0 - 2023/03/13 10:26:21 GMT+08:00
### Added
* Added Zamza, Yamato Cursed, Diva Reinforcement to the list of Characters
* Added Training Start 1 to 4 to the list of Items
* Added Arcade Cursed 2 and Arcade Cursed 3 to the list of Breakables
### Changed
* Now shows an alert during startup if no valid bigfile or backup is foun. A backup is still created if a valid bigfile is present and a backup is missing.
* Changed the text "modded v7 bigfile" to just "modded bigfile" since there's no way to check which version the modded bigfile came from anyway
### Fixed
* Made to work with game version `v8-s 14424`
* Corrected sprite path of Walkie Talkie

## 4.2.9 - 2023/01/11 18:54:48 GMT+08:00
### Added
* Added the ability to customize items in the `Customizer` > `Item` tab which includes food and weapons.
* Added `Multi` (multi-hit), `+HP` (recover green HP), `X Force`, and `Y Force` (horizontal and vertical launch strength) properties to hits of character moves
* Added `Launch height on hit` property to characters which sets how high they fly when hit
* Added a toggle in the Text Editor to affect all languages with future edits
* Added a "Copy to all other languages" button in the `Text Editor` which copies all current items to other languages
### Fixed
* Fixed the "Clear list" button not actually working in the Character Customization list (the listed items would still be there)
* Fixed the custom text not applying if coming from a protected swap
* Fixed the issue in the Text Editor where the row of Game Text will disappear from the list if the item is made blank. This only happened if the list was filtered before this edit
* Fixed the label indicating that the loaded swap mod was "editable" if it was actually "protected"
* Fixed the issue in the Text Editor where the `Include the Swap File when Saving` setting did not get included in the exported file

## 4.2.8 - 2022/10/26 18:11:06 GMT+08:00
### Added
* Added a Text Editor. You can access this by going to
`Customizer` then `Game Text`. The contents of the text editor
can be imported and exported using `*.swaptext` files.
* Added a function where, upon loading a swap, it automatically
checks the swap file for errors and fixes it without modifying
the swap file. There was a very rare error related to having a
swap with customized characters where the actual swap was
missing which crashed the Swapper. An alert box will pop up
showing what the swaps are when this error is found.
* In case of a crash or an error, the Swapper now saves a log
file in the same folder
* A log file is now created when the app crashes

## 4.2.7 - 2022/08/31 13:41:00 GMT+08:00
### Fixed
* Fixed the issue where, when loading any swap mods, characters
had buggy names if they didn't have any customization (does not
affect swap mods)
* Fixed the issue where, upon clicking the "Clear swap list"
button, characters had buggy names if they didn't have any
customization (does not affect swap mods)

## 4.2.6 - 2022/08/09 22:00:50 GMT+08:00
### Fixed
* `Remove armor from all enemies` in the Difficulty screen
now work as expected
* `Perma Armor` is now reset along with all the character
properties when the Reset Character button is used
* Correctly set the version to 4.2.6 - previous 4.2.6 release
had incorrect version of 4.2.5 despite having the updates

## 4.2.5 - 2022/08/06 03:08:14 GMT+08:00
### Added
* Added `Perma Armor` and `Move Armor` in the `Character
Customizer` screen. For those who are unaware, most armor in
the game are are related to moves. `Perma Armor` is used by
characters like the boss version of Max and the DJs.
* In the `Difficulty` screen, added a tickbox to remove all
armor from all the enemies
* Added `Move Direction` and `Move Trigger` options to
characters' moves. This can be used to change a move's inputs
or add inputs to a move without an input.
* Added tooltip for `Character Size` in the `Character
Customizer` screen
* If and when a character's health and speeds are changed, their
original values are now shown to the right of their respective
text boxes
* In the `Swap Author` screen, added a box for a `Short
Description` to display in the Arcade difficulty selection
screen
* In the `Swap Author` screen, added checkboxes for the Author, 
Title, and Date Created info to show them in the Difficulty
selection screens in the game
* Added reference to the original values of Health and Speed
in the `Customize Character` screen if values have been modified
* Added a button on the Difficulty screen to copy the text in
`Download URL` 
### Changes
* A swap mod made or saved starting v4.2.5 will have 3 access
types: Protected, Read-only, and Editable. The first two (2)
items are meant for distributing the mods after the modder
finalizes them. `Protected` swap mods won't show anything in
the interface when loaded. `Read-only` swap mods will show
details but nothing will not be changeable. `Editable` swap
mods are meant for use by the modders while they are working on
a mod unless they intend to distribute the mod while allowing
anybody to make changes to it and redistribute it.
* `Editable` swap mods now use the `*.swapedit` file extension
* Loading a swap file now switches to the `Swap Author` screen
automatically
* Loading a `Protected` swap mod now disables all other screens
except the `Swap Author` screen
* Loading a `Read-only` swap mod now disables all items which
were previously modifiable (e.g. character HP, swap list, lives,
etc.)
* Loading a swap mod made before 4.2.5 will be treated as
`Editable`
### Fixed
* Fixed the issue where the location of the bigfile is
"forgotten" everytime the Swapper is updated
* Fixed the issue where the character customization is not being
accepted if the only thing changed is the character's size
* In the `Difficulty` screen, loading a swap file will now
preselect the difficulty it was based on
* Fixed various issues in resetting characters and moves in the
`Character Customizer` screen
* Pyrop now uses the correct thumbnail for her portrait instead
of Ruby's
* Vulture and Wayne now use the correct thumbnails for their
portraits
* Loading a swap mod now resets the Swapper's memory of changes
if any (e.g. HP changed before loading swap would remain)
### Removed
* Removed the additional alert which pops up if "Apply Changes"
was clicked and then cancelled

## 4.2.4 - 2022/05/10 10:35:01 GMT+08:00
### Added
* Added `Character Size` in the `Character Customizer` screen.
This changes the sprite size of the character and their hitbox.
* Added `Gravity` in the `Difficulty` screen. Please note that
this is "permanent" in such a way that it will stay as specified
until the next bigfile modification.
* In the Randomize Characters screen, Regular enemies now have
their own IGNORE and ISOLATE tickboxes (thanks Bragdras, VGamer)
### Changed
* Dunphy (not electro) changed from Regular+ to Regular category
### Fixed
* Global `Hitstop` and `Hitstun` values and value types now load
correctly from a swap file
* Fixed the name index of some character variants using the same
index: Ms. Whatever/Ms. Whatever (elite), Dunphy/Dunphy (Electro)
* Fixed visual bug in the user interface of the Difficulty
section where it was always the width of the Global Player
Hitstop dropdown menu which changed when the other Hitstop or
Hitstun dropdown menus were changed
* In the Character Randomizer screen, the "ISOLATE" Regular
enemies tickbox is now ticked and disabled when the "IGNORE"
tickbox is enabled - as it should have been

## 4.2.3 - 2022/04/02 06:41:28 GMT+08:00
### Fixed
* MAJOR: Values in the Difficulty screen are now based on the
difficulty they are based on and not on a "base difficulty".
For example, from 4.2 to 4.2.2, Mania+ enemy HP values would be
125% and spawn multiplier would be 200%. I messed up when I
forgot that I based the values on the difficulties they were
based on and should NOT have been based on the "base" difficulty
(Hard). Relevant values like enemy HP, spawn multiplier, enemy
speed boost now start at 100% per difficulty. (thanks Bragdras)
Modders, kindly check your custom difficulty values. You may
have to redistribute if you created a mod with 4.2 to 4.2.2.
This problem may not affect you if you loaded a swap file from
before 4.2 and modified your values from there but please
double-check. My apologies.
* In the Difficulty screen, global Hitstop and Hitstun values
now initialize as 100 instead of 0 when set as %
* Gave Big Ben-SOR2 a different name index than Big Ben-SOR4
so they would not share the same name when customized


## 4.2.2 - 2022/03/28 22:14:34 GMT+08:00
### Fixed
* Fixed a minor but critical issue which may crash the app when
clicking on the "Apply changes" button on a system using a
locale (language/region) which isn't English

## 4.2.1 - 2022/03/26 21:36:27 GMT+08:00
### Fixed
* Fixed the issue where characters still had the names of the
characters they replaced when they are randomized and Battle
Royale is enabled in the Levels Customizer section
* Fixed the bug where Roo-SOR3 and Shiva-SOR3 were able to
pick up weapons but weren't able to use them anyway
* Filter in the Customizer is working now
* Fixed issue in the Difficulty section where values are not
loading from the difficulty they are based on
* Fixed Move damage where values were rounded up instead of
just being rounded off
* Fixed the issue where, upon loading a swap file, reset buttons
are still not enabled if a character has non-default values
* Gave Shiva-SOR2 a different name index than Shiva-SOR4 so
they would not share the same name when customized
* Gave Estel (Boss) a different name index than Estel (Playable)
so they would not share the same name when customized
* Fixed the issue where a swap mod's Date Created value did not
show up properly in-game even if it did in the Swapper. Before
this fix, it used the date/time when the changes were applied.

## 4.2.0 - 2022/02/28 01:10:59 GMT+08:00
