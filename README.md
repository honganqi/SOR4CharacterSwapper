# SOR4 Character Swapper

This app allows you to mod Streets of Rage 4 by swapping
specific characters and/or enemies or randomizing everybody!
This app only works for the Steam version of the game as far
as I know and is known to work only on the v5 patch of the
game released back in July 17, 2020. As of writing, I don't
know if this will work with v4.

## Requirements
This is known to work only on Windows 10. Microsoft .NET
Framework 4.6.0 is also required but this is built into 
Windows 10. This is also known to work only with the v5
version of the game on Steam.

## Usage
* Navigate to your `bigfile` is located; usually in
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Streets of
Rage 4\data`.
* Once you're done adding your swaps, randomizing or after
loading a swap file, click on `Apply changes`.
* You may use `Save settings` if you have a list of swaps
you want to back up or share. You can use `Load settings` to
load the swaps into the app.
* After applying swaps for the first time, a backup named
`bigfile_rep_backup` will be created automatically in the
same folder. This will be needed by the app to allow you to
restore your bigfile.

## Randomizer
* You may randomize your swaps for surprise games by
clicking on `Enemies only` or `Everybody`; the former will
randomize enemies only and the latter will randomize
everybody including playable characters. Click on
`Apply changes` if you're settled with the list or
`Clear list` and randomize again if you want.
* Bosses and minibosses are ignored by default to avoid
softlocking the game. You may choose to disable these
settings at your own risk.  These won't damage your copy
of the game but may prevent you from proceeding with your
game.
* Characters in the swap list will be ignored by the
randomizer. e.g. If you manually swapped Galsia into Goro,
Galsia will be ignored in the randomization.
* You do not have to close the app when you run the game and
you can execute swaps while the game is running, but you have
to restart the game for the changes to take effect.
* If you want to randomize again without closing the app,
click on the `Clear list` button before doing so to remove
all the characters in the list.

## Notes
* The author of this software will not be liable to any
damage to your game installation. If you lose your backup,
you can simply go to Steam and validate your installation to
restore it.
* This app is intended to be used for entertainment purposes
only. If you are not having fun with this, please restore
your files, delete this app, and purge it from your memory.
* If the selected `bigfile` is an original and valid v5
bigfile, this will be backed up as `bigfile_rep_backup` upon
clicking `Start Swapping`, otherwise a backup named
`bigfile_custom_backup` will be made instead.
* TL;DR Please back up your bigfile before doing this.
