This app allows you to mod Streets of Rage 4 by swapping
specific characters, items, breakables, and/or levels!
This app only works for the Steam version of the game as far
as I know and is known to work only on the v8 patch of the
game (v08-s r18163) released in March 21, 2023.

## Usage
* To get started, load your game's `bigfile` into the app. It
is usually in `C:\Program Files
(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Streets of Rage 4\data`.
* You can swap or randomize characters, items (pickups),
breakables, and levels by going to their respective tabs.
* Once you're done adding your swaps, randomizing or after
loading a swap file, click on `Apply changes`.
* You may use `Save settings` if you want to back up or share
a swap list you made. You can use `Load settings` button to
load the swaps into the app.
* After applying swaps for the first time, a backup named
`bigfile_rep7_backup` will be created automatically in the
same folder. This will be needed by the app to allow you to
restore your bigfile.
* If you have a modified bigfile containing swaps, you can
extract those swaps and save them onto a swap file by
clicking on `Extract swap list` then showing the list and
clicking on `Save swap list`.

## Randomizer
* You may randomize your swaps for surprise games. e.g. 
Clicking on `Enemies only` in the Characters tab will
randomize enemies only and clicking on `Everybody` will
randomize everybody including playable characters. Click on
`Apply changes` if you're settled with the list or
`Clear list` and randomize again if you want.
* The `IGNORE` checkboxes are there if you want the randomizer
to ignore them during randomization. You may also use the
`ISOLATE` checkboxes if you don't want those categories
getting randomized with the regular enemies. You may choose to
disable these settings. They are safe and won't damage your
game but I cannot guarantee the same for your sanity.
* Characters and items in the swap list will be ignored by the
randomizer. e.g. If you manually swapped Galsia into Goro,
Galsia will be ignored in the randomization.
* You do not have to close the app when you run the game and
you can execute swaps while the game is running, but you have
to restart the game for the changes to take effect.
* If you want to randomize again without closing the app,
click on the `Clear list` button before doing so to remove
all the characters in the list.
